# Therapy With Dr. Albert Krueger for Android

## Credits

- '[dino999z](https://x.com/dino999z)' and contributors for game creation, development and assets.
- '[The Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine](https://renpy.org/) by RenpyTom' for allowing the creation of the game through open source.
- '[Unkzittys](https://github.com/Unkzittys) (me)' for inserting the ported code and making the Android version.

## Recommendations

- Use Android OS version 5.0 or above.
- Avoid playing on a newer Samsung device (the used version of Ren'Py often causes crashes on Samsung devices with operating system version 11 or above).

## Tools Used

- [Ren'Py 7.4.5](https://www.renpy.org/release/7.4.5)
- [UnRPA](https://github.com/Lattyware/unrpa)
- [UnRPYC 1.1.8](https://github.com/CensoredUsername/unrpyc)

## Gestures System

Currently, there are two types of gestures programmed to perform predefined actions. They are:

- **Up Gesture**: Opens the game menu, if possible.
- **Down Gesture**: Hide the dialogue window.
- **Up-Down-Left-Right-Left-Right Gesture**: The default gesture included in Ren'Py games. It displays information on the total number of dialogues in the upper left corner of the screen, in addition to those already read and those read after the last save.
