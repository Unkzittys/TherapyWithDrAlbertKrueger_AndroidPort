# Therapy With Dr. Albert Krueger for Android

## Credits

- '[dino999z](https://x.com/dino999z)' and contributors for game creation, development and assets.
- '[The Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine](https://renpy.org/) by RenpyTom' for allowing the creation of the game through open source.
- '[Unkzittys](https://github.com/Unkzittys) (me)' for inserting the ported code and making the Android version.

## Recommendations

- Use Android OS version 5.0 or above.
- Avoid playing on a newer Samsung device (the used version of Ren'Py often causes crashes on Samsung devices with operating system version 11 or above, so try changing the renderer to GLES2 with the gesture of accessing the renderer choices menu if you still want to play on it).

## Tools Used

- [Ren'Py 7.4.5](https://www.renpy.org/release/7.4.5)
- [UnRPA](https://github.com/Lattyware/unrpa)
- [UnRPYC 1.1.8](https://github.com/CensoredUsername/unrpyc)

## Gestures System

Currently, there are four types of gestures programmed to perform predefined actions. They are:

- **Up Gesture**: Opens the game menu, if possible.
- **Down Gesture**: Hide the dialogue window.
- **Up-Down Gesture**: Opens the 'Render Choosing' screen. This is a built-in screen from the engine.
- **Down-Up Gesture**: Opens a window in the upper left corner of the screen displaying information about screen drawing processing. This is a built-in screen from the engine.

- **Up-Down-Left-Right-Left-Right Gesture**: The default gesture included in Ren'Py games. It displays information on the total number of dialogues in the upper left corner of the screen, in addition to those already read and those read after the last save.
